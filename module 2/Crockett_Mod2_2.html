<h2>Chapter Title: About Me</h2>

<p class="intro">
I grew up in Kansas and spent most of my early life there before eventually moving to Texas for work.
The move was a big change, but it opened the door to new opportunities and experiences.
<span class="sentence">Relocating pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow personally and professionally.</span>
</p>

<p>
After moving to Texas, I met my wife while living in Dallas.
We built our relationship there and started planning our future together.
A couple of years later, we decided to relocate again, this time to Houston.
</p>

<p>
Houston became the place where we really began to put down roots.
The city offered more career opportunities and a better environment for our growing family.
Over time, it has started to feel like home.
</p>

<p>
We have three boys who keep life busy and entertaining.
They are currently 3, 5, and 7 years old and always full of energy.
Being a parent has shaped my priorities and motivates me to continue improving myself.
